# Reddit-Top-Level-Comments
Chrome Extension: Only view 1 top-level Reddit comment thread at a time.
This is how I usually browse reddit, and I always had trouble finding the TLCs (top level comments) to start a new "story" of comments and responses again.
### Reasoning 
I sometimes get lost in a long thread of comments and want to abandon it. But I have trouble finding the top level comment  since all the lines on the left look the same and it's hard to determine where it stops. In reaction to this, I made buttons at the top of the comment section that let you show and hide the first X amount of top level comments... to make my comment reading that much faster :D
